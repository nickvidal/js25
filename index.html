         <div class="container">
            <p>The JavaScript language was created in 1995, initially developed in May and released to the public in December of that same year. Thus, 2020 marks its 25th Anniversary--certainly a huge milestone for this language that has become one of the most popular.</p>
            <p>The 25th Anniversary of JavaScript presents itself as a great opportunity for the community to look back in history and forward towards the future. What were the major milestones that marked its history and how will this already popular language evolve even further?</p>
            <p>The language itself and the community behind it has a rich history. JavaScript has been key to the formation of the World Wide Web. Organizations like the Mozilla Foundation, the W3C, and Ecma have played a major role in developing the language, and projects like jQuery and Node.js have contributed significantly in demonstrating JavaScript’s potential capabilities both on the client side as well on the server side.</p>
            <p>As for the future of JavaScript, one thing is clear: collaboration is key. The “Browser Wars” have come and gone, and neither users nor developers want to relive the problems brought by the lack of interoperability. Fortunately, open source has prevailed and represents the way forward in terms of development and governance of the JavaScript language and community.</p>
            <p>To celebrate the 25 years of JavaScript, please find below 25 milestones that have shaped its history:</p>

                  <p>Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded what would become Netscape  Communications Corporation and launched their first browser on September 9, 1994. Originally it was called Mosaic Netscape, but it was renamed as Netscape Navigator to avoid trademark problems with NCSA. The internal codename for the browser was Mozilla, which stood for "Mosaic killer" and indeed it rapidly became the most popular browser. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator">[Read More]</a></p>

                  <p>Marc Andreessen imagined a more dynamic Web and believed that a language easy to use by Web designers was needed. He recruited Brendan Eich, who in 10 days wrote a prototype for the Netscape browser in May 1995. The language was first called Moca, later LiveScript, and finally renamed JavaScript (to serve as a companion language to Java).  <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">[Read More]</a></p>

                  <p>Microsoft reverse-engineered Netscape's JavaScript to create JScript and made it part of Internet Explorer 3. The introduction of proprietary, non-standards-compliant extensions made it difficult for developers to make a single website that worked well in all browsers. Eventually Internet Explorer became the dominant software in the browser wars. <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">[Read More]</a></p>

                  <p>On January 23, 1998, with a steep drop in the browser market share, Netscape publicly released the source code of Netscape Communicator 5.0 in the hopes that it would become a popular open source project.

                  <p>Firefox began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project by Dave Hyatt, Joe Hewitt, and Blake Ross in 2002. To combat what they saw as the Mozilla Suite's software bloat, they created a stand-alone browser, first named Phoenix, later Firebird, and finally Firefox. Firefox version 1.0 was released on November 9, 2004. Firefox's speed, usability, and marketing helped it gain market share agains't Internet Explorer. Within five years of launching, Firefox accounted for nearly a third of all web browsing. <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.mozilla.org/press/2004/11/mozilla-foundation-releases-the-highly-anticipated-mozilla-firefox-1-0-web-browser/ ">[Read More]</a></p>

                  <p>WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable target for compilation of high-level languages like C/C++/Rust, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications. The precursor technologies were asm.js from Mozilla and Google Native Client. <a target="_blank" href="https://webassembly.org/">[Read More]</a></p>

                  <div class="date">March 12, 2019</div>
                  <p>The OpenJS Foundation was formed from a merger of the JS Foundation and the Node.js Foundation in March 2019. The mission of the OpenJS Foundation is to support the healthy growth of JavaScript and web technologies by providing a neutral organization to host and sustain projects, as well as collaboratively fund activities that benefit the ecosystem as a whole. <a target="_blank" href="https://openjsf.org/">[Read More]</a></p>

                  <h2>Deno</h2>
                  <div class="date">May 13, 2020</div>
                  <p>Deno is a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript that is based on the V8 JavaScript engine and the Rust programming language. It was created by Ryan Dahl, original creator of Node.js. It was announced by him on JSConf EU 2018 in his talk "10 Things I Regret About Node.js". Deno explicitly takes on the role of both runtime and package manager within a single executable, rather than requiring a separate package-management program. <a target="_blank" href="https://deno.land/">[Read More]</a></p>
